# Recognizance Week 2 

## Introduction

This module explores essential steps in data preprocessing and delves into the core concepts of machine learning, emphasizing regression and classification techniques.

## Understanding Machine Learning

ML, or Machine Learning, is a branch of artificial intelligence dedicated to developing algorithms and models enabling computers to learn and make predictions or decisions based on data, without explicit programming.

## Data Exploration and Cleaning

Data preprocessing is a pivotal aspect of any data-centric project. Data scientists invest a significant portion of their time—approximately 80%—in preparing data for analysis. It involves examining data, implementing modifications, and structuring it to facilitate efficient processing by computer programs.

## Regression

Linear regression serves as our entry point into machine learning algorithms. The primary objective is to comprehend the fundamental concepts, grasp their rationale, and discern their interconnectedness. You may observe resemblances with previously learned mathematical or statistical principles! What renders Machine Learning captivating is its logical framework, so focus on comprehension rather than rote memorization.

## Classification

Data scientists often face the challenge of automating decisions for business scenarios. Is an email an attempt at phishing? Is a customer likely to churn? Is the web user likely to click on an advertisement? These are all classification problems.

Classification represents perhaps the most pivotal form of prediction: the aim is to forecast whether a record corresponds to a 1 or a 0 (phishing/not-phishing, click/don’t click, churn/don’t churn), or in some instances, one of several categories (e.g., Gmail’s inbox categorization into “primary,” “social,” “promotional,” or “forums”).
